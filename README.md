## About

This is a bespoke java library specifically for use in [SEEK](http://seek4science.org). It uses Apache POI to create specially crafted Excel spreadsheets for describing biological sample for a given sample type. Users can then download and use this spreadsheet to collect sample details, and then upload to SEEK for automatic extraction.

It is wrapped by the Sample Template Generator Gem, found at https://github.com/seek4science/sample-template-generator-gem

This is developed as part of the [FAIRDOM Project](http://fair-dom.org)
