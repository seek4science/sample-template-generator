## About

This is a bespoke java library specifically for use in [SEEK](http://seek4science.org). It uses Apache POI to create specially crafted Excel spreadsheets for describing biological sample for a given sample type. Users can then download and use this spreadsheet to collect sample details, and then upload to SEEK for automatic extraction.

This is developed as part of the [FAIRDOM Project](http://fair-dom.org)
